# Aggregations

## Selection and visualization of aggregations

- The aggregation mapping list clearly defines the composition of the aggregation levels.
- Modellers can take the relevant aggregations from the sectors from the reference data set.
- Modellers can carry out possible further aggregations themselves based on the level of detail and assistance (documentation).
- A tree structure can be used to display the aggregations graphically.
